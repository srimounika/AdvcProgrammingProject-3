 <b><font size="+1">Programming Project 3<br>
</font></b></center><p><b>Project #3 - A Parser Generator Project.</b> </p>
 
<p><b>yacc/lex Compiler Front End.</b> </p>
 
<p>You will rewrite the grammar from your compiler into a left-recursive format typical of LR parsers. 
Implement a parser for the LR version of the grammar using yacc and lex. I will 
expect you to have four separate files for your parser:&nbsp; a .l file from lex and a .y file
from yacc, a header file with necessary constants for token types, and a <span style="font-family: monospace;">makefile</span> for the project. </p>
  In
class we will discuss the use of lexical analyzer/parser generators and
you will be provided with examples of simple programs which you will
extend.<b><br>
<br>
</b><b>Input and Output<br>
</b>There will be no user interaction with the program. The program
will be invoked 8 times from a shell script as demonstrated in class
(see below in deliverables). Input will be via command line parameter
of
the file to be parsed, specified in the script file. The final legal
program must demonstrate proper identifier processing, nested
expression processing and control constructs nested inside
others.Output will be to
the console reporting either a successful parse or a syntax error
message.<br>
<b><br></b><b>
Other Policies</b> <br>


 All projects will be individual.

</span></p>


You will submit all your work in a .zip file to the DropBox
 for the course on <tt>elearning.uwf.edu.</tt> Place <span style="font-style: italic;">all your files</span> in a single directory named <span style="font-family: monospace;"><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;firstInitial&gt;&lt;lastname&gt;-p&lt;projNumber&gt;.</span> <br>
<br>
For instance, my&nbsp; submission would be<span style="font-family: monospace;"> jcoffey-p3. </span>zip that folder into a .zip file and upload it to the appropriate dropbox.<br>

<br>

So, submit a single zip file containing a single folder, with the following items in the folder:<br>

 
 
 
<ul>
<li>An updated version of the grammar of your language. </li><li>Your lex and yacc programs, the header file, and the makefile<br>
</li><li>A User's manual regarding exactly what this submission does and how to 
	run it (and any problems or deficiencies the submission might have)<br>
</li><li>Four examples each of both legal and illegal programs of increasing complexity. The programs 
	should be of increasing complexity, with the last demonstrating all features 
	of your language.</li><li>A
script that runs all legal and illegal programs
as a batch, citing success or flagging the error.</li></ul>
